			<p>Hey! I'm Jennette. I'm an LA based writer/director. I have a passion for writing character-driven pieces that explore serious subject matter in an offbeat way. </p>

			<p>I started out as a child actor and while that experience certainly lent some psychological trauma (sound guys can be especially creepy!) I knew early on that I loved the on-set environment and all the collaboration it takes to bring a project to life. I hoped one day to go behind the camera so that I could be more creatively involved and, let’s be real, so that I could wear turtlenecks unironically.</p> 

			<p>In 2017, I wrote and directed my first project - a dramedy short called The McCurdys, based on my life growing up as a child actress in a Mormon family with a mom dying of cancer. (I had a colorful childhood!)</p>

			<p>I fell in love with the process and I wrote/directed three other shorts within the year, including one that wound up becoming my first released project - “Kenny”, about a thirtysomething burnout who sacrifices his own dreams to take care of his dying mother - which was featured on Short of the Week and in The Hollywood Reporter, and is an official selection for the 2019 Florida Film Festival.</p>

			<p>I have several new projects coming out soon. I'm excited to share them with you and I hope you enjoy. I’ll be over here wearing a turtleneck.</p>

			<p>- Jennette</p>
